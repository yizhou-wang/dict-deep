# Dict-Deep: An Architecture for Action Detection in Videos using Over-Complete Dictionary Learning
Yizhou Wang and Lingyu Zhang

This project explores the traditional as well as novel approaches solving action detection problems. It is common to use neural networks which always cost a lot of time for training and testing. To solve this bottleneck of action detection, “Dict-Deep” and “Faster-C3D” architectures are proposed. Dict-Deep architecture adds feature extraction and over-complete dictionary learning steps before neural network. Then, Dict-Deep algorithm is implemented and tested on Weizmann and KTH human action dataset, which obtained 99.2% on Weizmann and 80.4% on KTH.
